        "A binding site is a piece of DNA where a certain protein prefers to bind. The piece of DNA can be described as a string consisting of letters A, C, G, and T, which correspond to nucleotides Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine.\n",
        "In this exercise the length of binding sites is eight nucleotides. They are stored in the file `data.seq`,\n",
        "and the binding sites there are classified into two classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Part 1. Write function `toint` that converts a nucleotide to an integer. Use the following mapping:\n",
        "```\n",
        "A -> 0\n",
        "C -> 1\n",
        "G -> 2\n",
        "T -> 3\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Write also function `get_features_and_labels` that gets a filename as a parameter. The function should load the contents of the file into a DataFrame. The column `X` contains a string. Convert this column into a feature matrix using the above `toint` function. For example the column `[\"GGATAATA\",\"CGATAACC\"]` should result to the feature matrix\n",
        "```\n",
        "[[2,2,0,3,0,0,3,0],\n",
        "[1,2,0,3,0,0,1,1]]\n",
        "```\n",
        "The function should return a pair, whose first element is the feature matrix and the second element is the label vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "Part 2. Create function `cluster_euclidean` that gets a filename as parameter. Get the features and labels using the function from part 1. Perform hierarchical clustering using the function `sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering`. Get two clusters using `average` linkage and `euclidean` affinity. Fit the model and predict the labels. Note that you may have to use the `find_permutation` function again, because even though the clusters are correct, they may be labeled differently than the real labels given in `data.seq`. The function should return the accuracy score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Part 3. Create function `cluster_hamming` that works like the function in part 2, except now using the [hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) affinity. Even though it is possible to pass the function `hamming` to `AgglomerativeClustering`, let us now compute the Hamming distance matrix explicitly. We can achieve this using the function `sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. Use the affinity parameter `precomputed` to `AgglomerativeClustering`. And give the distance matrix you got from `pairwise_distances`, instead of the feature matrix, to the `fit_predict` method of the model. If you want, you can visualize the clustering using the provided `plot` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which affinity (or distance) do you think is theoretically more correct of these two (Euclidean or Hamming)? Why?"
